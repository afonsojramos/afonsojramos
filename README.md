### Heyo, I'm Afonso, nice to meet you! 👋

### 📍 Currently working as a Software Engineer at [yld](https://yld.io/)

_Open-Source & competitive programming enthusiast, music lover & concerts front-liner, beer afficionado, peripatetic by nature._

_I ❤️ to learn on a daily basis, to face new challenges and to contribute to open-source. Github is a playground for my experiments._
