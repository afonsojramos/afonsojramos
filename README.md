### Heyo, I'm Afonso, nice to meet you! 👋

### 📍 Currently working as a Software Engineer at [yld](https://yld.io/)

_Open-Source & competitive programming enthusiast, music lover & concert front-liner, beer afficionado, and peripatetic by nature._

_I ❤️ learning on a daily basis, facing new challenges, and contributing to open-source. Github is a playground for my experiments._
