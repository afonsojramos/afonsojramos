### Heyo, I'm Afonso, nice to meet you! 👋

### 📍 Currently working as an Junior Software Enginner at <a href="https://www.hostelworld.com/pt/" style="color: #f25621">Hostelworld</a>

_Open-Source & competitive programming enthusiast, music lover & concerts front-liner, beer afficionado, peripatetic by nature._

_I ❤️ to learn on a daily basis, to face new challenges and to contribute to open-source. Github is a playground for my experiments._

A little more about me... with npm installed, just type the following on a console:

```
npx afonsojramos
```
